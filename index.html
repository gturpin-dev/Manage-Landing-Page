	What’s different about Manage?
	
	Manage provides all the functionality your team needs, without 
	the complexity. Our software is tailor-made for modern digital 
	product teams. 
	
	01
	Track company-wide progress
	See how your day-to-day tasks fit into the wider vision. Go from 
	tracking progress at the milestone level all the way done to the 
	smallest of details. Never lose sight of the bigger picture again.
	
	02
	Advanced built-in reports
	Set internal delivery estimates and track progress toward company 
	goals. Our customisable dashboard helps you build out the reports 
	you need to keep key stakeholders informed.
	
	03
	Everything you need in one place
	Stop jumping from one service to another to communicate, store files, 
	track tasks and share documents. Manage offers an all-in-one team 
	productivity solution.
